# FlubFighter-Build

> Flub Fighter is a 3-D, action-party game where up to four players fight against each other for flubby dominance. Flubs cannot be harmed through punching alone; only a well-placed trap or punch that send a Flub flying into dangerously placed lethal hazards can score kills.

This is a Unity project I worked on with a team of other artists, designers, and programmers from approximately 2014-2016. Included in this repository are some files for a few of the assets I created for this game. I mostly did effects, but also helped with some modeling and texturing. 

You can download and run the executable [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geuREbCtrhjJQGdwC0pb_tPBYZZJsBMV/view?usp=sharing).

It was also Greenlit on Steam, and its store page can be found [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/530340/Flub_Fighter/), though notably, it did not see a full release.
